# CertGuard: AI-Powered Secure Certificate Issuance & Verification Platform

CertGuard is a comprehensive, enterprise-grade platform designed to definitively combat academic and professional certificate fraud. It modernizes and secures the entire lifecycle of a credential‚Äîfrom issuance to verification‚Äîby integrating multiple layers of cutting-edge security technology, including AI, cryptographic hashing, and immutable blockchain principles.

## ‚ú® Core Features

### üîê Secure & Intelligent Issuance Workflow
- **AI-Powered OCR**: Use Google's Gemini to scan physical legacy certificates, automatically extract details, and pre-fill the digital issuance form, minimizing manual entry and errors.
- **Issue New Secure Certificates**: Create new, digitally native certificates with a robust, multi-layered security protocol applied instantly at the point of issuance.

### üõ°Ô∏è Multi-Layered Security Protocol
- **PKI-based Hashing**: Core certificate data is signed with a SHA-256 hash, creating a unique, tamper-proof digital fingerprint for every credential.
- **Immutable Hash Chain**: Inspired by blockchain, certificate hashes are linked in a chronological chain in Firestore. Any attempt to alter a past record breaks the chain, making tampering immediately evident during an integrity check.
- **Dual Embedded Signatures**: The unique cryptographic signature is embedded in two redundant ways:
  1. A secure, scannable **QR code** on the face of the document.
  2. An **invisible digital watermark** (using steganography) hidden within the document file's pixels.

### üîç Real-Time, Multi-Factor Verification
- **Flexible Verification Methods**: Verifiers can either scan a QR code with their device's camera or upload a digital file (PDF, PNG, JPG).
- **Comprehensive Validation Pipeline**: The system performs a multi-factor check in seconds, providing unparalleled trust in the result.

### üë§ Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- **Segregated Workflows**: The application provides secure, distinct portals for Institutions, Verifiers, and Administrators, each with a unique set of permissions and tools tailored to their function.

### üìà Admin Monitoring & Security Dashboard
- **Centralized Oversight**: A dedicated dashboard for administrators to monitor verification trends, view forgery alerts, and manage system-level security controls.
- **Proactive Security**: Admins can manage a real-time blacklist of institutions and verify the integrity of the entire certificate hash chain on-demand.

## üöÄ The Verification Pipeline

CertGuard's verification process is a step-by-step pipeline designed to be both fast and exhaustive:

1.  **Input**: A verifier scans a QR code or uploads a document.
2.  **Signature Extraction**: The system extracts the digital signature from both the QR code and the invisible watermark.
3.  **Registry Cross-Check**: It fetches the authoritative hash for the certificate's ID from the central Firestore registry.
4.  **Cryptographic Comparison**: It compares both extracted signatures against the authoritative hash. A mismatch at this stage signifies a forgery.
5.  **Chain Integrity Audit**: The system algorithmically confirms that the record's `previousHash` link is valid, ensuring the historical chain has not been broken.
6.  **Content Validation**: It checks the issuing institution and course name against pre-approved allow-lists.
7.  **Blacklist Check**: Finally, it queries the real-time blacklist to ensure the issuing institution has not been flagged as compromised or fraudulent.
8.  **Verdict**: A final, trustworthy result (`Valid`, `Partially Valid`, or `Invalid`) is presented to the verifier with a detailed breakdown of each check.
